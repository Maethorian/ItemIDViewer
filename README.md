# ItemIDViewer
A developer utility addon to determine item Id's in game for Elder Scrolls Online
Once installed and active it will write the Name and Id of an item to the ingame chat when hovering over that item.

Currently only works in player inventory, craft bag, player bank, guild banks, guild store but only when selling
